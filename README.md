# PHP-API-Template

This is a template for a PHP API. It is a simple example of how to create a RESTful API using PHP.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `php -S localhost:8888 -t .`

## Usage

The API has the following already created endpoints:

- `GET /bookings` - Get all bookings
- `GET /bookings/{id}` - Get a booking by ID

Note: The endpoints return simple text for demonstration purposes. You have to create your controllers and models to return the data you need.
